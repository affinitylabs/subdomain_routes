SubdomainRoutes Revision History

Version 0.2.4

* Added this revision history.
* Added #assert_recognizes_with_host and #assert_generates_with_host methods to
  ActionController::Assertions::RoutingAssertions, allowing testing of subdomain routes
  if you're into that sort of thing.
* Override ActionController::Routing::Route#significant_keys to include the subdomain
  option in the case of model-based subdomain routes.
* Updated README to describe how to test with subdomain routes.
